If you’re maintaining an existing pollen and nectar flower mix block or strip, this action is rotational or static. This means you can either: You must establish a nectar flower mix as a block or strip on land entered into this action. You must use a grass-free seed mix which includes at least 6 flower species, with no individual species being more than 50% of the total mix by weight. The seed mix must include at least 2 of the following flower species: Once the pollen and nectar flower mix block or strip is established (usually from the second spring after sowing), you must maintain it.

You must supply the evidence if we ask for it. You can do the following actions or options on the same area in a land parcel as this action. Some actions or options can only be done on the same area if they’re done at a different time of year to this action. For example, winter cover followed by a summer companion crop. Read ‘What to do’ and ‘When to do it’ to find out when this action must be done. If an action or option cannot be located on the same area, you may be able to do it on a different area in the same land parcel.
